# Converted [Bootstrap - Template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/modern-business/) to WordPress Theme

This is a converted Bootstrap template to custom WordPress theme. The theme is modified to be a news website. Mainly the front page and single post page are transformed for the purpose. There are custom post settings sections and specific meta fields for the posts. Also, it is included admin notices and post reload functionality when some required meta fields are not filled.

The template is not fully built. It is a partial structure for a news website, and it should be improved and extended if you want this theme to be completed, and to use it properly.

## Using Description

* To use this template just clone the repo, or download it, and upload it to your site admin page (**Appearance->Themes->Add New->Upload Theme**).

* There are four area sections on the front page which could be managed from **Posts->Section 1 / Section 2 / Section 3/ Section 4**.

* In each section, it could be managed categories, posts sorted by parameters, ordered, it could be settings up posts per page or decided how many sliders the front page should have.
